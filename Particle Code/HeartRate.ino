This a Particle Photon project. It's Best Way to Get Started with your PulseSensor™ & Particle Photon. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) This shows a live human Heartbeat Pulse. 
2) Live visualization in Arduino's Cool "Serial Plotter".
3) Blink an LED on each Heartbeat and send BPM to Unity via Partile Cloud.
4) This is the direct Pulse Sensor's Signal.  
5) A great first-step in troubleshooting your circuit and connections. 
6) "Human-readable" code that is newbie friendly."
